# AMoRE

Angular Momentum model Of Relativistic Electron beam transport (AMoRE) is a Fortran code parallelized using OpenMP for fast simulations of laser-generated relativistic electron beam transport in solids and dense plasmas. It computes the two first angular moments of the exact relativistic Belaiev-Budker kinetic equation for relativistic electron beam transport in solids and dense plasmas completed with the Minerbo maximum angular entropy closure. It thus takes into account collective effects with the self-generated electromagnetic fields as well as collisional effects with the slowing down of the electrons in collisions with plasmons, bound and free electrons and their angular scattering on both ions and electrons. This model allows for fast computations of relativistic electron beam transport while describing the kinetic distribution function evolution. More pieces of information can be found in my [PhD manuscript](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01238782/document) and in this [peer-reviewed article](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/16/7/073014/pdf). Citations to these references are recommended and appreciated for publications of scientific results using AMoRE in peer-reviewed journals. 

# Compiling the code

Modify the [makefile](https://github.com/michaeltouati/AMoRE/blob/main/Makefile) as a function of the wished compilation options and the compilers installed on your computer and then type :
```sh
make
```

# Running a simulation

Fill the wished input-deck [init_parameters](https://github.com/michaeltouati/AMoRE/blob/main/init_parameters) (all parameters are described inside) and type :
```sh
./amore
```
# Plotting the simulation results

Type :
```sh
make plot
```
to plot all the simulation results automatically. It can also be plotted separately
all 2D density plots of both relativistic beam electrons and target electrons/ions hydrodynamic moments as well as the electromagnetic fields and target transport coefficient by typing
```sh
python3 sources/tools/extract_maps.py
```
Similarly, the relativistic beam electron distribution can be plotted by typing
```sh
python3 sources/tools/extract_distribution.py
```
and the simulation can be checked by typing 
```sh
python3 sources/tools/extract_initialization.py
```
```sh
python3 sources/tools/extract_material.py
```
and
```sh
python3 sources/tools/extract_energy.py
```
that plot respectively :
* the initial properties of the relativistic electron beam,
* the transport coefficients of target electrons(ions) (ionization state, thermal capacities, electrical and thermal conductivities as well as electron-ion coupling factor) and 
* the time evolution of the diffetent energy contribution in the simulation. 

All simulation results are stored in text files located in the folder 'diags' and the python scripts used to make the plots are located in the folder 'extract_tools'.
The plots will be located in the folder 'figure'.
